Here's a project which involves creating a shopping menu. This shopping menu is first created using dictionaries and dataframes which display
the products, prices (in the dictionary called "products") and the availability (in the dictionary called "stock").

The Main Menu of this shopping app is created using if statements (conditionals). 

This is a good start for someone new to Python programming and willing to try creating tiny programs :)
